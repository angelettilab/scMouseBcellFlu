# scMouseBcellFlu

This is the repository associated with the publication _Single cell BCR and RNA analysis after respiratory virus infection reveals spatiotemporal dynamics of antigen specific B cell response_.

This repository contains the code and supporting files necessary to reproduce the analyses reported in the publication.


## Single-cell RNA-seq analysis

To re-run the analysis of the scRNA-Seq data, the necessary workflow and scripts can be found in the [`scripts/scRNAseq_pipeline/`](scripts/scRNAseq_pipeline) subdirectory.


## BCR seq analysis

Scripts necessary to reproduce the analysis of the B-cell receptor sequencing data can be found in the [`scripts/VDJ_analysis/`](scripts/VDJ_analysis) subdirectory.
