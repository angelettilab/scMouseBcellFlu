[Sauron](https://github.com/NBISweden/sauron) is a single cell analysis pipeline that allows user to run simple or complex experiment designs with very simple and intuitive functions. These functions are writen in R programming language using state-of-the art single cell methodologies and computing technology, making this a reproducible and efficient analysis tool. However, to use the functions, the user does not need to know R or other programming language, but can simply replace the parameter of the functions.
